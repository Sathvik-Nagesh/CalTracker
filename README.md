✨ Key Features

    AI-Powered Food Logging:

        Text Search: Use natural language (e.g., "a cup of coffee and two eggs") to instantly get nutritional information.

        Photo Recognition: Snap a picture of your meal, and our Gemini-powered vision model will identify the food items and estimate their calories.

        Manual Entry: A simple form for when you need to log specific items with precision.

    Personalized Goals: Create a user profile with your age, weight, height, and activity level. The app automatically calculates your personalized daily calorie (TDEE) and macronutrient targets.

    Comprehensive Dashboard: Get an at-a-glance view of your day, including:

        Calories consumed vs. goal.

        A dynamic pie chart for macronutrient breakdown (Protein, Carbs, Fat).

        Water intake and exercise tracking.

    Intelligent Exercise Tracking: Log your physical activities, and the app uses AI to estimate the calories burned based on your weight and the exercise duration.

    Progress Visualization: Track your weight over time with an interactive line chart and review detailed logs from previous days.

    Secure & Persistent: Built with Firebase Authentication and Firestore, your data is securely stored and synced across sessions.

    Modern UI/UX:

        Clean, responsive design that works beautifully on desktop and mobile.

        Includes both Light and Dark modes.

🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
Prerequisites

You will need a Firebase project and a Google Gemini API Key.

    Firebase:

        Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

        Enable Authentication (with Email/Password and Google providers).

        Set up Firestore as your database.

        In your project settings, find your web app's configuration object.

    Gemini API Key:

        Get your API key from Google AI Studio.

Installation & Configuration

    Clone the repo:
    Generated sh

          
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CalTracker.git
    cd CalTracker

Use code with caution. Sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Configure Firebase:

    Open the firebase.ts file.

    Replace the placeholder firebaseConfig object with the configuration from your own Firebase project.

Configure Gemini API Key:

    This project is configured to use an environment variable for the API key. You will need to set up a way for process.env.API_KEY to be available in your development environment. For example, using a .env file and a build tool like Vite or Create React App.

    Create a .env file in the root of your project:
    Generated code

          
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

        

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

    Use code with caution.
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    (Note: If not using Vite, prefix may vary. The code expects process.env.API_KEY)

Run the app:

    This project uses a modern, build-free setup with ES modules and import maps. You can serve it with any simple static server.

Generated sh

      
# If you have Node.js, you can use 'serve'
npx serve

        Open your browser to the local address provided (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
